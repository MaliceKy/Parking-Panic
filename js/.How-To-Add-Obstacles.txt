How to add obstacles 9/13/24

STEP 1:
Create the HTML structure and CSS styles for your new obstacle with an img you want to use inside the img folder

Example:
    HTML:
    <div id="dumpster-obstacle">
    <img id="dumpster-img" src="img/dumpster.png" alt="Dumpster">
    <div id="dumpster-hitbox"></div>
    </div>

    CSS:
    /*Dumpster Obstacle */
    #dumpster-obstacle {
        position: absolute;
        left: 400px;  /* Adjust as needed */
        top: 300px;   /* Adjust as needed */
        z-index: 2;
    }

    #dumpster-img {
        width: 100px;  /* Adjust size as needed */
        height: 80px;  /* Adjust size as needed */
    }

    #dumpster-hitbox {
        position: absolute;
        width: 90px;  /* Slightly smaller than the image */
        height: 70px; /* Slightly smaller than the image */
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.3);  /* Blue with transparency */
        border: 1px solid blue;
        z-index: 3;
    }

STEP 2:
Once you have the HTML and CSS set up, you need to register the new obstacle in your main.js file.
Under the "Obstacle Vars" you need to reference the newly created barrier-obstacle and its hitbox. 
You do this by selecting them with jQuery.

Example:
    Javascript:
    const dumpsterHitbox = $('#dumpster-hitbox');
    const dumpster = $('#dumpster-obstacle');

Step 3:
Once you have the obstacle and its hitbox selected, register them by calling registerObstacle.

Example:
    Javascript:
    // Register obstacles
    registerObstacle(dumpsterHitbox, dumpster);

Step 4:
Profit.
